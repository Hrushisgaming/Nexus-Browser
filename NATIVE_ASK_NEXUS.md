# Native "Ask Nexus" button (level 3: compiled into the browser)

Patch: helium-macos/patches/nexus/native-ask-button.patch  (already listed at the end of helium-macos/patches/series)

## What it does
- Adds an "Ask Nexus" button (crosshair icon + label, same style as Chrome's Ask Gemini button) at the RIGHT END of the
  horizontal tab strip. It is outside the tabs: with many tabs the tabs shrink and the button keeps its size.
- Click = open/close the "Chat with Nexus" side panel (extension id iokkgaheigikheidihfidjdkocoaplco, fixed by the key in
  nexus-chat/manifest.json; if you ever change that key, change the id in horizontal_tab_strip_region_view.cc too).
- Three-dot menu: new check item "Show Ask Nexus" (above Settings) turns the button on or off. Stored in the profile
  pref nexus.ask_button_shown (default: on).
- New vector icon chrome/app/vector_icons/nexus_crosshair.icon.

Files changed: chrome/app/vector_icons/{BUILD.gn,nexus_crosshair.icon}, chrome/browser/ui/tabs/tab_strip_prefs.{h,cc},
chrome/browser/ui/toolbar/app_menu_model.cc, chrome/browser/ui/views/frame/horizontal_tab_strip_region_view.{h,cc}.

## Status: NOT compiled
Written against the exact Chromium 155.0.8059.39 files with Helium 0.19.2.1's patches applied first. `git apply --check`
passes on that tree, and every API used was checked against the headers at that tag. It has NOT been compiled or run (a Chromium
build needs a Mac and hours). Expect that the first build might stop on a small compile error; the error message will name
the line, and the patch is only ~280 lines.

## Not covered
- Vertical tabs / zen layouts: they use a different region view, so no button there (use the toolbar crosshair or the in-page pill).
- Dragging the button, a bottom-left dock, and choosing docked vs floating. Those would be more C++.
- If the three-dot menu in this build is the newer web-based one, the "Show Ask Nexus" item may not appear (the button itself will).
- Chromium's alternative tab strip ("tab strip unification" feature) is not patched; Helium uses the classic one by default.

## Build it
1. Follow helium-macos/docs/building.md (macOS 12+, Xcode 26, Homebrew deps). Needs roughly 100+ GB free and several hours.
2. From helium-macos/: ./build.sh   (this applies the patches, including the Nexus one, and produces a Helium .dmg)
3. Put that .dmg in nexus-rebrand/base/ and run nexus-rebrand/build_nexus_dmg.sh to rebrand it into Nexus.dmg.
   (nexus_patch.py edits resources by content, so it should work on your own build; if it complains, send me the message.)
4. If the compile fails: send me the first error lines and I'll fix the patch.
